Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 33, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 35
- google_maps_flutter_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- sqflite_android compiles against Android SDK 34
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\uygulamalar\sehiruygulamasi\android\app\build.gradle:

    android {
        compileSdk = 35
        ...
    }


FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
The Android Gradle plugin supports only Kotlin Gradle plugin version 1.5.20 and higher.
The following dependencies do not satisfy the required version:
project ':location' -> org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.4.20
