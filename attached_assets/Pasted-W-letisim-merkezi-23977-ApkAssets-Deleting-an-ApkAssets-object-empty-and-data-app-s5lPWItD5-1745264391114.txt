======== Exception caught by Flutter framework =====================================================
The following assertion was thrown during runApp:
Zone mismatch.

The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used. This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).
When the exception was thrown, this was the stack: 
#0      BindingBase.debugCheckZone.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/foundation/binding.dart:519:31)
#1      BindingBase.debugCheckZone (package:flutter/src/foundation/binding.dart:525:6)
#2      _runWidget (package:flutter/src/widgets/binding.dart:1544:18)
#3      runApp (package:flutter/src/widgets/binding.dart:1480:3)
#4      main.<anonymous closure> (package:belediye_iletisim_merkezi/main.dart:51:5)
