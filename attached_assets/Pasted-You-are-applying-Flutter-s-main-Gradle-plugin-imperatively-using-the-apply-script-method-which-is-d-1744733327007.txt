Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 33, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- firebase_core compiles against Android SDK 34
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 35
- google_maps_flutter_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 34
- sqflite_android compiles against Android SDK 34
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).

    android {
        compileSdk = 35
        ...
    }
